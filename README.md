## Description

JavaScript Angular2 Basics Code Review: Meal Tracker App. This application serves as a platform for the user to fill a form with the name, details, and calorie content of a meal they would like to add to their log. The meal is then added to a list. The user can click on a meal and edit any piece of information about the meal. The user can also choose from a selector to filter through the meals based on Health level (meals below 300 calories are logged as healthy, meals above 301 calories are logged as unhealthy).
